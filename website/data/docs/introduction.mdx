Similar to [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), Page UI is a collection of re-usable components and not a library you can install.<br/>
You can copy paste the components you need and then they become part of your codebase.

This is not a dependency you install, but more like code snippets you can use to build your landing page.<br/>
If you are familiar with Shadcn UI, this should feel similar. In fact, some components are built on top of Shadcn UI.

## Adding components

To add components to your codebase, navigate to the [component documentation](/docs/landing-page-components) and press the **Get code** button.<br/>

      Alternatively, use{' '}
      <a className="fancy-link" href="https://shipixen.com">
        Shipixen
      </a>{' '}
      to get a codebase with all components set up.
    </>
  }
/>

## Motivation

Designing and building landing pages that look good and convert well is hard business.<br/>
Most UI libraries focus on application UI, so when you set up a starer or boilerplate you end up staring at a blank canvas.<br/>
The time spent browsing through bloated templates, figuring out how to port them to your app and then customizing them is time you could spend on your product.

> Start from a blank canvas to create, start from Page UI to innovate.
